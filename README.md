# TDD to learn JS

This project tries to help you to understand the basics of programming using TDD from the very beginning.

## How to run the code

First, download the code from git and install the node modules:

```shell
$ cd your-code-directory
$ git clone git@github.com:ethien-salinas/tdd2learn.git
$ cd tdd2learn
$ npm install
```

Then, you can run the test cases just one time:

```shell
$ npm test
```

Or, run them in watch mode that creates a test environment for instant feedback:

```shell
$ npm run test:watch
```

## What do you need to run the code

You only need to be sure you have [node (get the LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your machine

## What is JestJS

[JestJS](https://jestjs.io/) was initially created at facebook to help run test cases. Now it's an open source project that has helped to go beyond [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) in the JS ecosystem.
